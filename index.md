Aside from my passion for technology, I also possess collaborative skills with a proven ability to motivate and work with a team to build a web application and effectively track changes. I am also a great communicator, strategic thinker, problem solver and innovative creator who can develop software that is customised to meet a companyâ€™s organisational needs, highlight their core competencies, and further their success.
